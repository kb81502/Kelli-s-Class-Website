      <p> Casting: With the casting as Maxwell
        Caulfield and Michelle Pfeiffer as the leads, the movie is given an air of
        seriousness. As a contrast the other characters bring comedic relief to the
        movie and bring the same energy of the original Grease.</p>
      <p>Plot:
        Another reason that makes this movie good is the plot that is mixed
        with heartfelt scenes, funny scenes, and scenes that are meant to be
        serious but are so bad that they are funny.</p>
      <p>Music: The singing from the main characters is very well
        done and a few of the songs are very catchy or heart-felt.</p>
        <p>Some of the good songs are: "Cool Rider" and "(Love Will) Turn Back
          The Hand Of Time "
