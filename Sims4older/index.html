      <p>Stephanie Zanone is a Pink lady and is required by the Pink lady code to only
        date the relating group: the T-Birds. The issue is Stephanie is looking for
        something more than the cheap antics of the T-Bird boys.</p>

      <p>Michael Carrington is Sandy’s cousin transferring from Australia to Rydell High,
        where the T-Birds and Pink ladies reign. Michael is a smart, nerdy guy, who now
        has a thing for Stephanie. His friend warns him to avoid her but he can’t get
        her out of his mind. Michael decides to ask stephanie out after she kisses him
        to prove a point to T-Bird leader Johnny Nogerelli following his win in a
        game of bowling. Stephanie rejects Michael and then, through song, tells him
        what kind of guy she wants to be with. She explains that she wants a guy who
        is a “cool rider” requiring him to have a motorcycle and a enticing additude.</p>

      <p>This prompts Michael to start saving for a bike. He can’t get a job so he begins
        writing papers for people of the school, mainly the T-Birds. Once he gains
        enough money, Michael buys a motorcycle and beings to learn how to ride it. Back
        at the bowling alley the T-Birds run into their rival gang, the Cycle Lords.
        The T-Birds can see they are outnumbered so the hide inside the alley. As they
        are hiding a ,new, mysterious biker beings to fight the Cycle Lords. We see that is
        Michael but it remains a mystery to everyone in the movie. Michael defeats the
        motorcycle gang and then proceeds to offer a stunned Stephanie a ride, which is
        postponed because a police starts going after Michael</P>

      <p>The next evening while working at a gas station/garage, Stephanie is surprised
        again by the Cool Rider, and they enjoy a romantic twilight motorcycle ride.
        Just as Michael is about to reveal his identity, they are interrupted by the
        arrival of the T-Birds and Pink Ladies. Before Michael leaves, he tells Stephanie
        that he will see her at the school talent show, in which the Pink Ladies and
        T-Birds are performing. Johnny, enraged by Stephanie's new romance, threatens
        to fight the Cool Rider if he sees him with her again. The Pink Ladies walk away
        haughtily, but this has little effect on the T-Birds' self-confidence.
        At school, Stephanie's poor grades in English lead her to accept Michael's offer
        of help. Johnny, upon seeing them together in a discussion, demands that
        Stephanie quit the Pink Ladies to preserve his honor. Although still enchanted
        by the mysterious Cool Rider, interactions with Michael reveal that she has
        become romantically interested in him as well. Michael ponders over the
        continuing charade he puts on for Stephanie.</P>
      <p>At the talent show, Stephanie and the Cool Rider meet up but are abruptly
        ambushed by the T-Birds who pursue Michael on their respective motorcycles,
        with Stephanie and the Pink Ladies following in a car. They chase him to a
        construction site which conceals a deadly drop, and the biker's absence
        suggests that he has perished below, leaving Stephanie heartbroken and
        inconsolable. During the Pink Ladies' performance in the talent show , Stephanie
        enters a dreamlike fantasy world where she is reunited with her mystery biker.
        She is named winner of the contest and crowned the queen of the upcoming
        graduation luau, with Johnny hailed as king for his performance of "Prowlin'"
        with his fellow T-Birds.</p>
      <p>The school year ends with the luau, during which the Cycle Lords appear and
        begin to destroy the celebration. However, the Cool Rider reappears. After he
        defeats the Cycle Lords again, he reveals himself to be Michael. Initially
        shocked, Johnny gives him a T-Birds jacket, officially welcoming him into the
        gang, and Stephanie is delighted that she can now be with him. Michael and
        Stephanie share a kiss and all the couples pair off happily at the seniors'
        graduation as the graduating class sings "We'll Be Together". </p>
